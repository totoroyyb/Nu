# Nu System

Nu is a new datacenter system that enables developers to build fungible applications that can use datacenter resources wherever they are—even if they come from different machines—without the need of reserving them, thereby significantly improving resource efficiency. Currently, Nu supports C++ applications.

## Supported Platform
We recommend you run Nu on [Cloudlab](https://www.cloudlab.us/). Currently, Nu supports Cloudlab's c6525 (thoroughly tested), r650, r6525, and d6515 instances. In theory, Nu is compatible with any X86 server equipped with a Mellanox CX5/CX6 NIC and Ethernet network. However, it may require some porting effort to adapt Nu to other platforms not listed above.

## Build Instructions
### Configure Cloudlab Instances
1) Apply for a Cloudlab account if you do not have one.
2) Now you have logged into the Cloublab console. Click `Experiments`|-->`Create Experiment Profile`. Upload the `cloudlab.profile` we provided.
3) Instantiate machines using the profile. 

### Build Nu
You can build Nu by simply executing the `build.sh` script we provided. You can either build on all of your machines using the same path or build on one machine and then distribute the folder to other machines. The build script will automatically execute the `setup.sh` script to correctly set up the environment for running Nu. You need to manually rerun the setup script each time after rebooting the machine.

After building Nu, you can test it by executing the `test.sh` script on one machine (don't run it simultaneously on multiple machines as it will cause interference). You are expected to see all unit tests passed. All test files are located in the `test` folder; they also serve as a good reference for how to write Nu programs.

## Reproducing Paper Results
You can find our code and push-button scripts in the ``exp`` folder.
